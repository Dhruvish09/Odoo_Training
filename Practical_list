Suppose the following input is supplied to the prografor i in range(1,7):
    for j in range(1,7):
        if j<=i:
            print("*",end=" ")
        else:
            print(" ",end=" ")	

    print()m:
9

8). Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following:
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
D 300
D 300
W 200
D 100
D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
Then, the output should be:
500

9). You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:
1: Sort based on name;
2: Then sort based on age;
3: Then sort by score.
The priority is that name > age > score.
If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
Tom,19,80
John,20,90
Jony,17,91
Jony,17,93
Json,21,85
Then, the output of the program should be:
[('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]

10). Write a program which are divisible by 7 and between a given range 0 and n.

11). Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
Then, the output should be:
1,3,5,7,9
